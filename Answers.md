Q1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.

The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities in the diagram is one-to-many. 
This means that a single product category can have many products associated with it, but a single product can only belong to one category. 
This relationship is enforced by the presence of a foreign key in the "Product" table called "category_id". 
The "category_id" column references the primary key ("id") of the "Product_Category" table.

Q2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?

There are a few ways to ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it:

(i) Add a NOT NULL constraint to the "category_id" column in the "Product" table. 
This will prevent any products from being inserted into the table without a valid category ID.

(ii) Create a foreign key constraint on the "category_id" column in the "Product" table that references the primary key of the "Product_Category" table. 
This will not only prevent products from being inserted with invalid category IDs, but it will also ensure that the referenced category actually exists in the "Product_Category" table.

(iii) Use a database trigger to check the validity of the "category_id" before a new product is inserted. 
This can be a more complex solution, but it can give you more control over the validation process.
